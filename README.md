Repo contains all the course projects from the CSC6301 course

# Contents

# Module 1
Create a Python class, saved it in a ﬁle, and document:
The ﬁle itself;
The class;
All class methods, including the constructor.

# Module 2
Create a Java implementation of Bubble Sort algorithm and document it using javadocs

# Module 3
Find a Java code on the Internet:
It needs to have at least three interacting classes within;
Generate a class diagram for the code you found;
Analyze the code with respect to encapsulation and modularity guidelines

# Module 4
Implement a program that reads a list of Integer numbers from the scanned input and saves them into a Linked List sorted from the smallest to the largest.
Be sure to use the Collections Framework and follow code guidelines and document your code accordingly

# Module 5
Plan and execute a maintenance task to your last project (Project #4) adapting to be now a Stack and not a LinkedList
Implement a program that reads a list of Integer numbers from the scan input and saves them into a Stack sorted from the smallest to the largest:
Please make sure this is a maintenance task and you are not re-writing the program from scratch!
Use Collections Framework

# Module 6
There is no project for Module 6 as this project was creating a GitHub profile and uploading projects 4 and 5 to GitHub.
Pack your Project 04 and your Project 05 and upload them in your created GitHub profile;
Your projects should approximatively follow the recommendations of GitHub with respect to documentation

# Module 7
Use the findPrimes program and analyze using cProfile to find which function should be changed to make it faster
Once you found it, optimize it and analyze the new code with cProfile again;
Write a report with your software versions and your analysis
